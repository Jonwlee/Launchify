# Launchify

Launchify-
-	Tab/Set Functionality - incomplete, can create but cannot delete existing tabs without using console
-	Input Functionality - incomplete can create but cannot delete, code that gets the text from the input boxes needs to be reworked
-	Creating chrome tab functionality - needs to be done, api usage weird, code should be reworked
